The Principles of Data Science course is one of my favorite subjects. As a Data Science student and enthusiast, I always maintain a keen interest in data. I pursued this course during my master's in Data Science at UMKC. PDS provides a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts, techniques, and tools used in the field of data science. This course covers topics such as data manipulation, data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining.

This particular repository consists of assignments from PDS.
